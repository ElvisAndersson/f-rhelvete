Hey, I'm Elvis. I believe that one never truly stops learning since there are always new things and technologies emerging. Continuing to educate myself in IT is something I will always do in my spare time because of my genuine interest. I enjoy the challenge of tackling almost impossible problems, and it's something I dabble with during my free time.
